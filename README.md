The goal of this project was to create a game on the Android platform in order to learn how to support multiplayer gameplay for augmented reality. This was done in Unity and made use of the Augmented Space Library (ASL) being developed by Greg Smith. The game we made is a cross-platform point collection game where you race against other players to collect the most coins. In order to prevent or hinder other players from collecting coins, the players can make use of spells such as a slow spell, which slows down players who enter an area of effect or the rock spell, which creates a rock that can block players. Players on Android devices can move around as well as pan their camera to look around the level or to aim spells. On the PC platform, players can use the keyboard and mouse to also move around and aim spells.

Through completing this project we have gained a good understanding of game development, augmented reality, and multiplayer functionality. As an added benefit, many of the skills learned here can be transferred to other areas of software development.
